ABSTRACT
=================================
This report discusses the development of a prototype mobile application, mainly focusing on the collaboration and design techniques throughout the process. During the semester in  Clayton Lewis’ Human Centered Computing class, we explored the ideas and practices from the research in human-computer interaction, to the design of interactive systems, to even tools for education and creativity. After large amounts of user testing and cognitive walkthroughs, the final prototype envelopes the basics of our learnings and displays the foundations of user centered computing and design.

INTRODUCTION/REQUIREMENTS
=================================
Grocery shopping for most people pertains to going to the nearest store and purchasing everything needed from there, while others will carefully read through all sales and coupons to find the cheapest deals across stores. One shopper is focused on time efficiency but not cost, while the other spends more time but pays significantly less money. Shoppers must choose between saving time or saving money, as there does not seem to be a system to maximize both money and time, until now.

Purpose
----------------------------------
EZList is a mobile application aimed at providing users a simplistic and efficient system of grocery shopping by calculating the most time and cost efficient routes and stores around your area based on what the user is planning on buying. To provide users with an effortless experience we envisioned incorporating personalized settings and shopping routes as well as a built in photo parser to read in a grocery list written by hand. These additions resolve many key challenges of the time consuming process of searching through every advertisement or flyer for the best deals around town by completely automating the process. The photo parser will also allow shoppers that prefer writing down physical notes use the application effectively without forcing them to change their habits.

Originality
----------------------------------
Even though everyone has been grocery shopping or at least understands the idea of it, there does not seem to be a popular application that will look through multiple stores and their prices. Although there are apps created by specific stores to show their own prices and sales, our application allows users to find prices from every store around them, distinguishing our applications from anything else on the market.

DESIGN
=================================
The core principle of our attempted design was simplicity.  Having clean page layouts that were easy to look at was a high priority, as was offering a platform that would be simple to navigate.  Upon designing the user interface, we chose to use a very limited color palette and high-contrast iconography.   This helps to keeps new users engaged and makes the app more accessible to the disabled (more to come on that topic later).  Below we will walk through each phase of the app, discussing its intent and how we went about achieving said intent.  


Sign In Options
----------------------------------
Figure 1 depicts the EZList Sign In page.  You can see right off the bat that minimalism was our goal aesthetically.  One particularly important feature of this page is the allowance of users to sign in using Facebook or Google+.  This provides the opportunity for users to share lists and sales with friends, and perhaps network with other similar shoppers around the area in the future.  A small error message will be displayed if the two typed passwords do not match, but otherwise this page’s functionality is simply getting us into the app.  Let’s go inside and take a look.

Homepage
----------------------------------
Figure 2 depicts the EZList Homepage.  Here we have all created lists laid out in order of creation.  You can also access every feature of EZList from this page, so, when in doubt, users can always return here to see all of their options.  Above you see the “pinned” icon.  Upon creating new lists, users have the choice to pin the calculated route to the homepage so that it can be quickly accessed in the future.

On one hand, we want to emphasize that grocery prices change daily, and one of the biggest selling points for EZList is that it offers a way of staying on top of these prices.  Therefore, people can get the most out of our app by using it to find the cheapest route right before going out to shop.  This way they are not being fed outdated information, and this way the pin feature becomes deconstructive.  At the end of the day, however, we came to the consensus that users should be allowed to make use of features that they might feel are helpful, period.  We recommend that new prices are calculated right before the user goes out to buy groceries, but if the user wants to make plans around a saved route, so be it.

As you can see, we have included an “add new list” icon there at the top as well.  Down below users can access recently deleted lists (which will remain in this folder for twenty days after deletion unless restored) and the search filters too.  It was mentioned earlier that the choice to use pictorial buttons was certainly deliberate.  This way, people with reading handicaps or that have trouble understanding English will find our app a little easier to use.  For example, if someone sees a “plus” symbol as opposed to the word “add”, they are more likely to realize that this is how they should create a new list, whereas anyone that does not speak English or suffers from dyslexia would find the word to be a hurdle.  True, EZList revolves around word-based grocery lists, but any efforts we could take towards making things easier on the disabled were efforts we were more than willing to entertain.          

Adding a List
----------------------------------
Figure 3 depicts the EZList “Add List” page.  It was important for us that the user was given a choice right upon entering our app, so we’ve provided two different ways of adding new lists. The first way of adding a list uses a picture of a handwritten list that the user can either take on the spot  or upload, and the app will then parse that picture, turning it into a typed out version. Since we saw that not all people particularly like or are able to use a phone camera, we ensured that they could also type it in by hand. 

With the added support for Facebook or Google+, we envision the possibility of people sharing their lists with their friends, so a third way of creating (or rather, importing) lists could eventually be implemented. If you see a great new recipe that a friend has shared on Facebook, for example,  you could potentially just hit a button to have that list saved to your phone instantaneously.  The primary goal of EZList is to show users the cheapest possible grocery shopping experience, yes, but the app has great networking promise down the road as well.  One weakness that we’ll admit to regarding list creation is that users will likely have rather vague items on the list.  For example, traditionally, someone might just put “bread” on a grocery list, then in the baked goods aisle will understand from past experience what brand and type of bread they like to buy.  There are two possible solutions here:  First, we could require that users be rather specific when adding list items, showing them lists of brands and types of the item.  That way the list would be very specific, thus finding prices would not be difficult.  The other possible solution would be to show average prices to the user.  For example, if that same user did just write down “bread”, EZList would look at the prices of all breads sold in surrounding stores and display the average price of bread at each store.  This would mean less accurate output on behalf of the app, but in turn offering users a more simple, quick input experience.  

Settings/Filters
----------------------------------
The filters and settings are perhaps the main attractions that draw people to our idea. Giving the users the ability to decide which way the app finds their groceries makes it more likely that more people will use the app. The options include: finding the best average price from one store to shop at for your whole list, the lowest cost for each individual item (if you want to go to more than one store). So now a user can choose, for example, if they are in a rush and only have time to go to one store that day, they can find out which one will be the closest as well as the cheapest, and make an informed decision based on that information. If they have ample time, they can easily change the settings to take them to any number of stores where they’ll be spending less money on certain items. There are also location settings for finding directions to the store of your choice. 

For the directions you can either use your phone’s GPS coordinates or a custom location that you can set to plan your route out. One reason for having a custom location is: You want to go to the grocery store after you get off work, but are not actually at work when you make the list, you can set your work as the start location and EZList will plan accordingly.  We also allow users to tell the app how far away from the starting point they’re willing to travel, in the case that they, for whatever reason, won’t be able to go very far.  Again, we wanted to keep this area as simple as possible, and while fifty different customizable settings may sound convenient, it also leads to a lot of content that most users will just be annoyed to see on their screens.  The search filters included are the bare essentials - we wouldn’t want them to distract from the real intent of this program.

EVALUATION
=================================
The EZList application was successful in accomplishing the requirements set forth in this document. Users were satisfied at the overall simplicity of the design and the opportunities that the application provides for them to facilitate their grocery experience. 

Positive Experiences
----------------------------------
Most users that tested the application were pleased with the implemented functionality and the general design of the application. The application featured multiple ways of inputting a grocery list to fit the needs of various users. In practice, different users used each method—strengthening the argument of having both options available. Additionally, the personalization features of the application were satisfactory in fulfilling the desires of the users. User testing demonstrated that most of the workflows and action items in the application were intuitive. The design was successful in providing important information to the user in a minimal amount of steps, and most users were able to complete the tasks within minutes or less. 

Shortcomings
----------------------------------
The final design of the application gave rise to some concerns. A number of users found a variety of the protocols of the application to be confusing. One challenge that our application faced and did not overcome was the labeling problem. Through various iterations of different labels, there was always a small subset of users who found the labeling and some icons misleading. Repeat users did not find the changing names to be a problem, once the function was understood. The tutorial mode proved to help some users with understanding the application, but also made the application seem more complex than necessary. 

CONCLUSION 
=================================
Walking the line between functionality and usability is very difficult. Starting out, we envisioned all of the wonderful things our app would be able to do. We did not realize that it would be so hard to actually make an interface that someone could understand and use in the way we planned. Along the way, we had to sacrifice some of the things we thought were good about the app, while adding things that we had not thought of the first time around.  The process of user testing was very valuable in that regard, since it allowed us to see how the app would perform in the “real world”, we could make changes based on these observations and hopefully improve the app. More time and user input is extremely helpful with improving the application, and along the way we made additions and improvements based on that alone. Obviously when creating an actual application there would be more attention pointed towards this type of work and criticism, thus leading to a more ideal application for everyone. Although it is always important to listen to what your users want, one person not liking the way something works is not a good reason to change your app. The customer is not always right. 
Although we did not actually write any code for this project, we got a good look at what goes into actually designing a usable smartphone app. Creating an application that is user friendly and completely functional is a tough task to say the least, but we certainly ended up making a huge dent in that process. Success within this spectrum was noticed at the ATLAS Expo when a great amount of people showed actual interest in our application, wanting to know if they could download our application right that moment. Although our application was not downloadable at that time, it certainly brought interest towards that thought. We took into account everything that was said to us during the expo and could possibly be implemented in a real life setting in the future. There would be various obstacles we would need to overcome when trying to complete this app, from constantly gathering product information from these food supply companies, all the way to somehow obtaining the API’s to put this actual application together. A functional and actual EZ List application could possibly be implemented in the foreseeable future, considering we actually got interest from possible investors in only two hours’ time at the ATLAS expo. It’s not something set in stone, but keep your eyes out for this application in the future.
